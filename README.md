# Emojilytics

## Abstract (1 paragraph)

- Here is where you put your 30-second pitch.

Businesses care what their customers think and more people than ever are using Emojis to express themselves on social media. As their use increases so to does the expressive power these characters will hold for text analysis. Utilizing emotion detection and machine learning classification on product review tweets I will determine if there exists significant linkages between certain tweets and emotion. This allowing a new way for businesses to know how their customers feel about them and facilitate more successful use of Emojis in advertisement. 

## Context (2 paragraphs)

- What is the problem?

Invented in 1998 Emojis have become a popular, practical, and fun way to convey meaning and emotion especially in the twitter space with a 140 character message limit. Sentiment analysis frameworks utilize lexicon to determine sentiment scores and classify emotions but many models do not possess the ability to analyze characters such as Emojis unless they are manually annotated. Further, it has been found that when utilized in combination with other Emojis it can shift the meaning of the individual Emoji which further inhibits simple manual annotation methods since intensity scores are seemingly subjective. 

- Why is it important to solve?

The fabrication of an emotion detection sentiment analysis that recognizes Emojis is important because as use continues to increase so to will the amount of expression is possessed by the Emoji in the text. While there does exist a lexicon of definitions for Emojis this instead is merely developer labeling of these characters which may not align with the actual use patterns of users since Emojis are used in combination and have developed new meaning through social media trends. Therefore for organizations, especially large global firms, the need to analyze how and why their consumers are utilizing emojis is ever-growing since a significant portion of market and customer retention analysis is centered around text analysis.

## Proposal (3 paragraphs)

(- What is the specific question are you trying to answer?)

I will evaluate the induced emotion profiles of Emojis with regard to their ability to predict word affect intensities as well as sentiment scores of tweets.

(- How will you answer it?)


(- What do you expect/hope to find?)


## Conclusion (2-3 paragraphs)

(- Summarize the problem and your solution.
- If applicable, describe how your solution could be important beyond your specific context--i.e. can it be generalized?)


(- Discuss limitations and potential future directions to take the project.)
